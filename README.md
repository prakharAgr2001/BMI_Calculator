🚀 Welcome to the BMI Calculator React App! 🌟

Dive into the magic of the State Hook with this simple yet powerful project. Using the useState hook, I've crafted a BMI calculator that not only crunches the numbers but dynamically updates health tips and colors based on your results. It's amazing how a small hook can make a big impact on user experience!

### Features:
- **Dynamic Tips:** Receive personalized health tips based on your BMI.
- **Colorful Feedback:** Watch the UI change colors to reflect your health status.
- **User-Friendly:** A sleek and intuitive interface for a seamless experience.
